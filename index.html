      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi Everyone - I am looking forward to meeting you all!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was raised in Connecticut, but have spent my adult life working in Moscow, Boston, and now Reston, VA.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy hiking and frequently travel out to the Shenandoah's with my hiking friends.  I also read or listen to several fiction and non-fiction books a month. I particularly enjoy historical fiction.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>At age 63, I am really more interested in making my current work more fullfilling than aspiring to a "dream job".  I work for myself and enjoy working, so I don't plan to stop for quite a while.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Reston, VA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>As my third or perhaps fourth carreer, I have been successfully developing educational games using e-learning software like Articulate and Adobe Captivate.  However, I find these tools cumbersome and limiting and want to be able to work with and perhaps even create other educational game and quiz content.</p>
